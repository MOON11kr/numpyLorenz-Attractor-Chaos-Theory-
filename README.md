# numpyLorenz-Attractor-Chaos-Theory-
The Lorenz Attractor is a set of chaotic solutions to a system of differential equations. It is famous for its butterfly-shaped pattern and is a cornerstone of chaos theory. This project involves simulating the Lorenz system using NumPy, analyzing its behavior, and visualizing the results.
